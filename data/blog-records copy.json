{"recordsCount":9,"data":[{"id":8,"body":"Today I've added the blog form into my front page, os it doesn't require to open the separate special page. Now it seems to be better but still doesn't work as good as I want. \r\nIn fact, it is a big problem for me to make the page \"as good\". Lack of experience is the reason. You can't know how something should look like if you don't know how it might look like: you don't know the rules of design, ergonomy or something. Of course, you've seen numerous pages and kinds of design, and you could imagine whatever you want - but how to realise it? How to implement? \"Trial and errors\" is the only way. Hope I will find a supervisor, who will help me to get improved.

Now it makes much easier to create new records: I don't need to entre the text directly into the server's code. Next step will be to integrate the form into the main page.

The most important lesson I learnt is: if something is going wrong, try again by FOLLOW THE MANUAL. I spen several hour to make my form sending POST requests and teaching my server to process that request in proper way. \r\nGlad to share a link that helped me a lot:\r\nhttps://itnext.io/how-to-handle-the-post-request-body-in-node-js-without-using-a-framework-cd2038b93190\r\n","date":"2020-12-08T10:00:00.000Z"},{"id":5,"body":"Today I've made basic design for my blog-page so it can look like a real web page of something like that.

This is my third blog record and I made it in order to test my adding-records-to-my-blog function. I spen my whole day to start my first own server for my personal page and blogging.

It is a situation when you have already learnt that everything muast be dame in proper way and you learnt something about proper way and you don't want to make it in a kind of \"let's do it in \"I'll rewise it later way\", but you don'n have a clue what is that \"proper way\" ","date":"2020-12-06T10:00:00.000Z"},{"id":2,"body":"Secondly, last year I realised that I want to become a programmer. Someone may say that it’s a little bit late to change the profession and line of work in the middle of my thirties, but it’s better to try and ensure than hesitate or regret for a lifetime. I started my page and this blog from scratch without using any site-making services, templates or other stuff. I started to learn coding a year ago (2019) and this site (I’ll let myself call it my project) is my homework, diploma project and portfolio all in one.

I live in non-English speaking country and don’t have opportunities and time to communicate to native speakers. I just can read and listen a lot, but not speak and write.

I tried to revise my server code to launch it on express, but it took a lot of time to figure out how to manage it. I completed a part of a video course on node/express, and this will try to do my best to set all up and run the blog as I want and start working on the frontend part. Hope I will because I want to implement lots of features and implement both bootstraps and the React in my blog. Unfortunately, they both are almost unfamiliar to me.
